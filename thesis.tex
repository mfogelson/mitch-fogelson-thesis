\begin{abstract}
The capabilities of our robotic systems are mostly being thought as limitations of control algorithms, compute power, and complex models. Robot designs have all but converged on the serial chain solutions, which are easy to design, optimize fixed continuous parameters and conform to the existing simulation frameworks. However these solutions are failing to understand the influence and trade-off between more complex designs whose geometry, composition, and compliance enable behaviors without the need for complex control, models or compute. In the aerospace community these designs have been essential to achieve the successful missions of systems like James Webb and many more. However, the systems require lots of physical testing and analysis to ensure success. In this work we imporve the capabilities of pantographic designs, reduce the design burden with new optimization methods, and introduce a differentiable simulation that supports these design for analysis and control. This thesis advances the capabilies of mechanical systems for robotic and aerospace solutions for future missions and goals.
