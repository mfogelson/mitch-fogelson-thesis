Since this docuement is so large, you should really compile this locally using the make file. Do this by simply navigating to the root directory and doing `make` a few times. You can also run `make clean` to clean up any aux files before running `make` a few times. 

You can also hook this up with overleaf, but make sure not to ask overleaf to compile the full thing at once. When I did this, I commented out every section except the one I was currently working on (like here https://github.com/kevin-tracy/thesis/blob/main/thesis.tex#L102).
