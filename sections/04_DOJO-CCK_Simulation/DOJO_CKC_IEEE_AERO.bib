	abstract = {Redundantly constrained mechanisms have – in general – non-uniquely calculated reactions when modeled as rigid multibody systems (MBSs). However, some of the reactions may be unique. An analogous problem of indeterminacy is also present in overactuated MBSs. This paper discusses the constraint-matrix-based method for the uniqueness analysis of the reactions and driving forces (torques) for MBSs with nonholonomic constraints. Four approaches are studied: The rank comparison, SVD, QR, and nullspace methods. The uniqueness criteria are written in a new way. The equivalence of the SVD, QR, and nullspace methods is shown. It is also presented how to check the uniqueness of the selected elements (reactions, driving forces, or more complex combinations) and their individual components. Subsequently, the impact of the driving constraints on the uniqueness of the joint reactions is discussed. Next, the uniqueness analysis using these three methods is extended to perform a newly proposed body-wise analysis instead of the usual constraint-wise analysis. Two examples of spatial systems (one with nonholonomic constraints) are considered to illustrate the approach. Moreover, the computational efficiency of selected methods is analyzed.},

	abstract = {The problem of calculating joint reaction forces in rigid body mechanisms with dependent constraints is discussed. Two essentially different reasons of constraint dependency are considered: the existence of redundant constraints and singular configuration of the mechanism. It is known that if constraint equations are dependent, the constraint reaction forces cannot be uniquely determined. In this paper it is shown that despite the fact that all of the constraint reactions cannot be uniquely determined, selected single constraint reactions or selected groups of reactions can be specified uniquely. Conditions, which must be fulfilled to obtain unique values of selected reaction forces in the presence of dependent constraints, are presented and proven. The concept of direct sum, known from linear algebra, is exploited. These purely mathematical conditions form a basis for numerical methods that enable detection of constraints with uniquely solvable reactions. Three different numerical methods are proposed. These methods are confined to constraint Jacobian matrix analysis, thus they can be easily implemented in a multibody software. Finally, two examples of detection of constraints with uniquely solvable reactions are presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper the generic DOF of rigid body mechanisms is investigated. This is the DOF of almost all mechanisms that can be built from a given set of kinematic pairs in a certain arrangement, but with arbitrary link geometry. The generic DOF is the most likely DOF in the presence of link imperfections. Furthermore, we are interested in the generic DOF of different types of mechanisms, i.e. when the link geometries are arbitrary, but in accordance with a certain type (e.g. planar, spherical, spatial). A widely used mobility criterion is the extended Chebychev–Kutzbach–Grübler (CKG) formula. It is proven in this paper that the generic DOF of a mechanism comprising loops of specific motion types, such as planar, spherical, and spacial, is indeed given by the extended CKG formula. In particular, mechanisms with arbitrary link geometry have generically a DOF δ=n-6γ, where γ is the number of fundamental loops, and n is the total number of joint freedoms. That is, almost all mechanisms are trivial (not overconstrained). Moreover, such mechanisms have generically no configuration space singularities. The mobility and the classification of mechanisms as overconstrained, underconstrained, or kinematotropic is considered in view of the configuration space. It is pointed out that the local DOF cannot always be inferred from the number of constraints (overconstrained mechanisms) nor can the differential DOF always be deduced from the local DOF (underconstrained mechanisms).},

Because the spacecraft is ‘brand new’ but cannot perform as designed and meet its mission objectives, deployables’ failures result in extremely large insurance claims. As an example, a total of almost \$800M in insurance claims resulted from solar array (SA) failed deployments in the past 23 years. This paper examines spacecraft deployables failures and anomalies that have occurred on a total of 53 different spacecraft, that can be directly attributed to deployment issues. It presents probable causes and best practices in order to prevent future failures. The paper’s overall goal is to highlight the criticality of appendage deployments and to share best practices with the ESMATS and AMS communities of mechanisms engineers.},

Due to the clearance existence in the revolute joints, it is important to choose an appropriate contact force model in analyzing the dynamic response of a slider-crank mechanism with clearances. The dynamic equations are established by combining the Newton–Euler equations with modified contact force model and improved Coulomb friction force model, and the Baumgarte stabilization approach is used to improve the numerical stability. According to numerical and experimental results, the method of continuous contact can be verified to be reasonable. Comparing dynamic the response between one clearance joint and two clearance joints in a crank-slider mechanism, it is easy to find a significant mutual coupling region due to the presence of two clearance joints by simply contact figures. The dynamic response in a mechanism with two clearance joints is not a simple superposition of that in mechanism with one clearance joint. Therefore, all the joints in a multibody system should be modeled as clearance joints.},

Such clearance is necessary for the component assemblage and to allow the relative motion between the connected bodies. This clearance is inevitable due to the manufacturing tolerances, material deformations, wear, and imperfections. The presence of such joint clearance degrades the performance of mechanical systems in virtue of the contact and impact forces that take place at the joint. Contact analysis is a computational bottleneck in mechanical design where the contact changes. Manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to error. To address these problems, a geometrical contact analysis method based on kinematic simulation, using CAD software is developed. An equivalent kinematic linkage mechanism is constructed according to contact position of pin and hole assembly. Results of kinematic and dynamic analysis of a four bar linkage with joint clearance shows that the contribution of joint forces at slower input speed also degrades the performance of mechanism.},

And a joint clearance model with a revolute joint (R-joint) is built. Based on the model, the minimum joint clearance introduced, which keeps mechanisms moving smoothly, is found when the components of the linkages have a certain deformation. The correctness of the proposed method is verified with a numerical case, and the optimal position for clearance introducing is analyzed.

JWST was successfully launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. All 50 major deployments were successfully completed by January 8, 2022. The observatory performed all mid-course correction maneuvers and achieved its operational mission orbit around the Sun-Earth second Lagrange Point. All commissioning and calibration activities have been completed and JWST has begun its science mission. Its present performance meets or out-performs all requirements. Launching over 20 years after its mission concept review, the JWST Observatory is a first and only of its kind of facility. This program faced many unique challenges that were not only technical in nature but also organizational and managerial. We describe the challenges faced by the JWST systems engineering team, the way the team addressed them, and make recommendations for focus areas of future flagship missions, which will likely face similar challenges. It will not explicitly address the cost challenges of the mission. We first describe the mission and its over-arching challenges. We then describe the tailoring of systems engineering processes and methods used to address these challenges and effectiveness. The events, tasks, issues, and their resolutions and the resulting specific lessons learned from the project are discussed with the over-arching recommendations for future flagship missions that derive from these lessons.},
