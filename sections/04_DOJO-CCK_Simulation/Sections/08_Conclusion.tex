In this paper, we developed a new framework for a data-driven, physics-based digital twin for linkage analysis, incorporating joint clearance and joint friction estimation. We demonstrated the digital twin's current capabilities and limitations in replicating real-world mechanisms through simulation-to-simulation and hardware experiments. The ability to identify jamming and capture joint constraint forces through the physics engine with SVD factorization is of particular interest. Future work will investigate the jamming behavior and design features that can help mitigate this problem. While the current study assumes uniform joint clearance and focuses on revolute and fixed joints, future work will expand the model to support additional joint types and improve the automatic threshold selection for SVD truncation. Future research will also involve testing the digital twin framework in more complex and real-world scenarios to enhance its capabilities. Overall, this work is the first step in next-generation tools for space-based deployable structure design to be more effective and efficient with a higher chance of mission success.
