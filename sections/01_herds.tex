\chapter{Non-Planar Hierarchical Composition of Extending Metamaterials for Deployable Load-Bearing Structures}\label{sec:herds}
Structures and materials with geometric hierarchy exhibit enhanced strength-to-weight ratio. In volume-constrained scenarios, such as packing payloads into a rocket fairing, deployable structures enable the efficient transport of load-bearing forms. When optimizing the strength-to-packing efficiency of payloads, this work shows that non-planar hierarchical compositions {of deployable structures} can dramatically improve performance. To this end, the paper describes {a new pantographic design,} the Pop-Up Extending Truss (PET), which uses the composition of scissor elements to enable out of plane reorientation, enhancing the bending stiffness by over 100\% compared to other translational scissor variants with equal mass and linear packing. Additionally, by composing multiple PET structures in a Kresling pattern we show this new structure - which is refered to as HERDS (Hierarchical Extending and Reorienting Deployable Structures) - is capable of supporting 10x higher bending, compressive, torsional, and tensile stiffness at 25-200x extension ratios compared to non-hierarchical {deployable} structures when designs are constrained by initial volume. A physical HERDS prototype achieved a 50x extension ratio and supported compressive and bending loading. Practical applications for this new {class of} deployable structures include large space structures, deployable infrastructure, and compact medical devices.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:herds:introduction}
{Engineers continue to push the boundaries of large-scale space structures to extend the capabilities outside of earth. One such example of this is the James Webb Space Telescope, with its sun shield spanning over 10 tennis courts, enabling the capture of unprecedented images of the universe. Previous work by the authors proposed a preliminary evaluation of a kilometer-scale space structure from a single rocket launch to support artificial gravity~\cite{fogelson2024herds}. A kilometer-scale design is 50x longer than the JWST and 10x longer than the current ISS. The design of such a structure must optimize strength-to-packaging efficiency to achieve this in a single launch with existing space vehicles. Alternative approaches aim to replicate Earth-based construction methods by transporting raw materials and assembling structures in space~\cite{xue_review_2021}. However, this requires advanced coordinated robotic systems, which is an area of ongoing research. More commonly, as seen with JWST, a collapsible structure is prefabricated on Earth and compactly stowed for a launch with no in-space assembly required. This work builds on the previous study by the authors \cite{fogelson2024herds} by performing a more extensive design sweep of the non-planar hierarchical deployable mechanism and its subcomponents, offering a deeper analysis of design parameters, trade-offs, and metamaterial behavior in PET and HERDS structures.}

The aerospace and architecture industry has led advances in single-transforming load-bearing mechanisms as described in \cite{doi:10.1177/0266351117711290}. The aerospace community, constrained by rocket fairing size has demonstrated many examples of booms~\cite{chu_design_2014,fernandez_advanced_2017,noauthor_lightweight_2004,you_self-locking_2006,yang_wrapping_2019,yang_novel_2022,wang_blossoming_2020,shore_effects_2021,salazar_experimental_2021} and masts~\cite{brown_deployable_2011,harrison_nuclear_2013,li_deployment_2016,nagaraj_kinematics_2009, tibert_deployable_nodate,you_cable-stiffened_1996,yu_nonlinear_2021}. Although past successes have demonstrated the viability of these approaches, continued innovation remains crucial for future missions. 

{In the literature, many extending space structures exist, which have been segmented by Wang et al. \cite{WANG2024112557}, in a review paper on deployable space structures, into inflatable, elastic, and pantographic solutions. All of these structure types have a place in the space infrastructure landscape, and no one solution is a silver bullet for current and future deployable structure problems.} 

{Inflatable deployable mechanisms offer several advantages over rigid structures, particularly in terms of weight reduction and high packaging efficiency. In the review paper by Wang et al. \cite{WANG2024112557}, they include the following successful examples of inflatable deployable structures include the inflatable antenna used in the Echo I mission \cite{grahne2001deployment}, the antenna deployed on the STS-123 Space Shuttle Endeavor \cite{cooper2009rigidizable}, the inflatable radar (SAR) for Earth-sensing missions \cite{lou2000development}, and the inflatable solar arrays used on the Mars Rover \cite{cadogan1999inflatable}. However, several technical challenges remain, including optimizing packing strategies \cite{schenk2014review}, understanding inflation dynamics \cite{cui2012overview}, and developing accurate models \cite{dollah2017inflatable}. For kilometer-scale space structures intended for artificial gravity, inflatable systems are less suitable due to their susceptibility to micrometeoroid impacts and vulnerability to global buckling failure.}

{The use of thin-walled elastic members is touted for their high strength-to-weight properties and simple construction~\cite{fernandez_advanced_2017,yang_wrapping_2019,salazar_experimental_2021}. Variations of such structures display extension ratios exceeding 300x, but rely on material elasticity to deploy and maintain their structure~\cite{salazar_experimental_2021}. {Practical examples of these systems are the iROSA structures on the ISS \cite{schwanbeck2019advanced} and DaGHR antenna \cite{kelly2016scalable}. Although these structures offer advantages in self-deployment, the release of stored strain energy is often unpredictable, difficult to control, and highly dynamic. This can lead to unwanted vibrations and potential secondary damage. Thin-walled composite structures also suffer from low impact resistance, presenting durability challenges in space environments~\cite{noauthor_lightweight_2004}. Additionally, these structures face scaling limitations due to the significant elastic energy stored during deployment and their lower structural rigidity compared to conventional truss systems, making them less viable for kilometer-scale applications in microgravity.}} 

{Deployable truss structures, also known as pantographic structures, offer design versatility, allowing for customization and adaptation to various configurations based on specific deployment requirements. Compared to telescopic structures, they provide a higher spatial packaging efficiency and reduced weight. However, their design and deployment mechanisms are inherently complex and often require a large number of parts. In addition, Pantagraphic structures are limited by the aspect ratio or material thickness to achieve higher extension ratios. For a scissor-based mechanism, that means that the individual truss elements become very long and thin, leading to the possibility of local buckling. In the review paper by Wang et al. \cite{WANG2024112557}, they highlight the following deployable truss structures have been implemented in various applications, including extension masts ~\cite{kitamura1990development, tibert_deployable_nodate,perez-valcarcel_new_2021,kim_deployable_2021,puig_review_2010}, extension arms \cite{choi2019design}, flexible solar array paddles \cite{kojima1996development}, and telescopic masts for NASAâ€™s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission \cite{umland2012STRM}. Parallel deployable truss structures have been utilized in planar solar arrays, such as those on the Chinese Dongfanghong (DFH)-4 \cite{yuanyuan2022parameter} and DFH-5 \cite{ma2022recent} satellites, the Spacebus Earth communication satellite \cite{tian2021research}, and the Shijian 20 satellite \cite{cui2020orbit}. Another common application is for parabolic antennas, including those on the ETS-VIII \cite{meguro2009orbit} and Environment-1C \cite{shi2014design} satellites, as well as in MegaFlex solar arrays \cite{zhou2015development}. These applications benefit from pantographic structures, which are inherently free of strain energy, material-agnostic, and scalable, making them well-suited for large deployable systems. To the authors' knowledge, no kilometer-scale deployable truss structure has been deployed.}

{This work looks at a rocket fairing packing problem, where the structure seeks to both maximize the usable volume in the fairing in the stowed state and the linear extension in the deployed state}. At this scale, elastic deployable solutions are not feasible due to the large shear stress in the stowed state. Additionally, inflatable structures are not considered due to their limitations for bending applications. When constrained by a predetermined initial volume, Pantagraphic deployable structures must minimize material thickness to enhance packing density to achieve the necessary extension ratios. This necessity introduces an inherent compromise between the extent of extension achievable and the structure's load-bearing capacity. The geometric hierarchy in natural and architected structures improves the strength-to-density ratio for improved efficiency and performance~\cite{lakes_materials_1993,schaedler_architected_2016,bauer_nanolattices_2017, schwaiger_extreme_2019}. Biology incorporates {structural }hierarchy in their additive building processes, enabling enhanced mechanical properties~\cite{fratzl_natures_2007}. Bird bones exhibit structure on multiple length scales to match necessary loading requirements at extremely low weight~\cite{sullivan_extreme_2017}. Wood and plant stems use {structural} hierarchy to provide mechanical support against the elements~\cite{lakes_materials_1993,chen_bio-mimetic_2013}. In engineered systems, {this} hierarchy is incorporated in large structures, such as radio towers, bridges, and quite famously, the Eiffel tower~\cite{lakes_materials_1993}. {These structures are referred to as space frame structures and credited to Alexander Graham Bell in 1903~\cite{chilton_space_1999}.} With digital fabrication, hierarchical mechanical metamaterials can be tuned to exhibit extremal properties~\cite{banerjee_mechanical_2014,bauer_nanolattices_2017}. Despite the structural utility of hierarchy, the benefits of hierarchical designs of transforming and deployable structures have been muted. {We define "deployable hierarchy" as the combination of multiple transforming mechanisms arranged at different size scales, which has not been demonstrated in non-planar cases. }Planar hierarchy has demonstrated synchronized deformations and auxetic properties~\cite{xu_design_2017,gatt_hierarchical_2015}, with applications for architected area changes, but no added structural benefit over traditional extending structures (Figure \ref{fig:expansion}.B). 

Our research introduces a novel class of mechanical metamaterial structures that leverage {non-planar deployable }hierarchy to combine multiple separate deployable mechanisms at different size scales to improve the tradeoff between extension and strength-to-weight ratios with a wide range of tunable properties. This work makes the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We demonstrate that the non-planar {deployable }hierarchical composition of extension mechanisms enhances material packing density, improving mechanical properties at high extension ratios.
    \item By applying this framework to scissor mechanisms, we introduce the Pop-Up Extending Truss (PET) mechanism, which offers better packing density and bending properties than existing scissor-like variants.
    \item We provide an example of Hierarchical Extending and Reorienting Deployable Structures (HERDS), a {non-planar deployable hierarchical structure} that integrates the PET and Kresling mechanisms. Finite element simulations demonstrate improved mechanical properties at high extension ratios, and a prototype implementation of the structure is presented as a path toward practical applications.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Results}
\subsection{Hierarchical Composition {of Deployables} for High Extension}
\subsubsection{Composition of Linear Extension Deployables in Kresling Pattern} Through sliding, wrapping, or pivoting their material, structures can stow and expand, manipulating the pose of material members and thus volume. This work looks at structures that extend to many times their stowed length. When fully deployed, these structures can have high length-to-width ratios, making them vulnerable to bending and buckling. Therefore, the structure's extension ratio (ER) -- the ratio of the final length to the stowed length -- and flexural modulus (EI) -- a metric used to evaluate bending stiffness measured in the deployed state -- are considered to assess a structure for load-bearing applications \cite{mikulas_truss_2006}. Without a loss of generality, this work focuses on 1-DOF extending mechanisms, where a single parameter, such as the angle between the scissors, can represent the state of the structure. A structure seeking to achieve a high extension ratio must maximize the packing density by pivoting, sliding, or wrapping the subcomponents in relation to one another. The volume of a pivoting 1-DOF mechanism, such as a scissor mechanism or mechanical Kresling, described in Zhai et al. \cite{zhai_origami-inspired_2018}, can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:expansion}.A, transforms based on the rotation of the internal beams. The extension ratio for a translational scissor is expressed by:

\begin{equation}
    ER_{scissor} = \frac{l*cos(\alpha_f)}{l*cos(\alpha_i)} \approx \frac{l}{t} \quad \text{when}\quad cos(\alpha_f) \approx 1 \And n >> 1
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i$, $\alpha_f$ are the initial and final angles of the scissor, $l$ is the link length of the scissor, $t$ is the thickness of the link, and $n$ is the number of scissor units connected together. The extension ratio of the scissor mechanism is the ratio of the cosine of the final angle between the members to the initial angle of the members. This extension ratio of a scissor can be approximated as the aspect ratio of an individual member when there are many scissor units combined. The extension ratio of a Kresling mechanism is:
\begin{equation}
    ER_{Kresling} = \frac{r\sqrt{(2*cos(\phi_f)-1)}}{r\sqrt{(2*cos(\phi_i)-1)}} \approx \frac{r}{2t} \quad \text{when}\quad \frac{t}{r} << 1
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the radius of the mechanism, $\phi_i, \phi_f$ is the angle offset between the top and bottom plates of the Kresling (twist), and $t$ is the thickness of the Kresling members. Here, the extension ratio is again a ratio of the final angle to the initial angle and can also be approximated as an aspect ratio of the kresling members, which is a function of its radius. 

This shows that the only way to achieve high extension ratios for these mechanisms is to have high aspect ratio elements that are prone to local buckling when subjected to bending loads. Similarly, for other 1-DOF mechanisms that use pivoting and sliding deployment, these designs only contain a single packing direction. This means that the magnitude of possible expansion is fully determined by the dimensions of the initial bounding volume and the thickness of the individual members making up the mechanism \ref{fig:expansion}.A. This problem is exacerbated in the practical design of deployable mechanisms when the original bounding dimensions are constrained, leading to thinner individual members, leaving designs susceptible to buckling and local deformation.

% \subsubsection{Hierarchical Non-planar Mechanisms} 
Non-planar {deployable }hierarchy can be used to increase the extension ratio while maintaining favorable member aspect ratios. One example highlighted in this paper is the composition of scissor elements and the Kresling pattern, Figure \ref{fig:expansion}.C. This new structure hierarchically extends through multiple sequential reorientations of the individual elements. This hierarchical composition enables tighter packing of the sub-mechanisms to achieve high extension ratios. The extension ratio from HERDS is approximately as follows:

\begin{equation}
    ER_{HERDS} = \frac{n*l*cos(\alpha_f)}{r\sqrt{(2*cos(\phi_i)-1)}} \approx \frac{n*l}{2t} \approx \frac{r*l}{2t^2} \quad \text{when}\quad cos(\alpha_f) \approx 1 \And \frac{t}{r} << 1
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_f$ is the angle of the scissor mechanism, $\phi_i$ is the twist angle of the Kresling, $t$ is the thickness of the scissor links, $n$ is the number of scissor units, $l$ is the length of the scissor links and $r$ is the radius of the Kresling. The hierarchical composition increases the tunable parameters to achieve high extension, including the number of scissor units, kresling deployment angle, kresling radius, and member aspect ratio. 

An important note about the proposed design from Figure \ref{fig:expansion}.C, the hierarchical composition of the mechanism transformations must occur sequentially. The Kresling transformation, $T[\phi]$, is performed first, reorienting the scissor mechanism. Then, the scissor mechanism's transformation, $T[\alpha]$, can deploy the subcomponents smoothly, increasing the system extension. These transformations are not commutable; for example, in the collapsed state, the transformation of the scissor mechanism, $T[\alpha]$, would not lead to the effective extension of the mechanism. This is not always the case when composing deployable mechanisms, as in Figure \ref{fig:expansion}.B, the transformations commute.

By manipulating the orientation of substructure stacking through {deployable }hierarchical design, we achieve high packing efficiency without increasing the component aspect ratio. This demonstrates the benefits of hierarchical deployable structures for extension ratio but does not consider the structure's stiffness yet. The stiffness of the deployed structure depends on the extended material's final deployed architecture. The next section considers various scissor structures and their effect on hierarchical design stiffness.

\end{figure}
A translational scissor mechanism has a low flexural modulus when fully deployed, making it susceptible to bending failures. Using a translational scissor mechanism as the substructure for the HERDS leads to a major limitation of the overall mechanical stiffness. Through finite element analysis, the flexural modulus (bending stiffness) of the scissor mechanism is shown to be less than that of a solid beam with the same cross-sectional area, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:flex_comp}.A. While the hierarchical composition of a scissor and Kresling mechanism provides extension benefits, the poor bending stiffness limits the usefulness of the hierarchical design. 

\subsection{Improved Bending Stiffness}
By applying a non-planar composition of scissor mechanisms, we developed a novel deployable structure known as the Pop-Up Extending Truss (PET), first described by Fogelson et al. in \cite{fogelson2024herds}. {The PET consists of three scissor mechanisms: two short-link translational units and one long-link translational unit with a polar offset. This offset enables out-of-plane motion during deployment, resulting in multi-axis reorientation of the substructures.} This unique composition allows the structure to simultaneously extend and expand, forming a triangular truss configuration (Figure \ref{fig:PET_expansion}). {The PET differs from other triangular scissor mechanisms, such as \cite{you_cable-stiffened_1996}, which retain a triangular void in the center when collapsed. In contrast, the PET structure flat-packs, significantly improving packaging density and making it well-suited for integration into a non-planar deployable hierarchy following a Kresling pattern.}

{In the stowed state, the long scissor unit occupies the width of the two smaller units, enabling flat packing. As the PET deploys, the width of the long scissors changes at a different rate than that of the short scissors, which forces an out-of-plane reorientation and results in the formation of a triangular truss.} This geometric transformation increases the structureâ€™s minimum bending moment of inertia, thereby enhancing its resistance to bending and buckling.

For this analysis, all structures were modeled using beam-based finite element methods (FEM) to evaluate comparative structural performance. The material type and Youngâ€™s modulus ($E$) were held constant, so differences in stiffness are primarily due to changes in the bending moment of inertia, $I_x = \int_A y^2 dA$ or $I_y = \int_A x^2 dA$. In idealized systems, placing structural mass further from the centroid increases bending and buckling resistance. {However, in truss and lattice-based structures, both local and global deformation modes must be considered as the aspect ratios and densities of constituent beams change.} {To evaluate performance, we conducted a simulated cantilever beam test across various extending topologiesâ€”independent scissor mechanisms, the PET, and a solid reference beam with equivalent bundled cross-sectional areaâ€”under the weakest configuration: in-plane bending with a fixed displacement.} Flexural modulus was estimated using:
\begin{equation}
    EI = \frac{FL^3}{3d}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the reaction force, $L$ is the effective length of the mechanism, and $d$ is the tip displacement.

{Figure \ref{fig:flex_comp}.A shows that as the PET extends, its effective flexural modulus increases at a greater rate than either of the short- or long-link scissor mechanisms alone, with a maximum observed improvement of $68\%$ over a solid beam with equivalent bundled cross-sectional area. We additionally compare the PET to independent short- and long-link scissor mechanisms adjusted to have equal mass by increasing their cross-sectional area. The PET, when built from square-cross-section beams, achieves a $50\%$ stowing advantage over an equivalent-mass scissor mechanism with rectangular cross-section. Structurally, the PET demonstrates a $111\%$ bending stiffness improvement over the long-link scissor and a $115\%$ improvement over the short-link scissor.} 

{To validate the accuracy of the beam model approximation used in the FEA simulation, we conducted physical tests using an Instron machine, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:flex_comp}.C. The correlation between the experimental results and the simulated structures is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:flex_comp}.D. Additional information about the Sim2Real validation and parameters can be found in SM Section 5.}

\subsubsection{Scaling Effects of PETS} To understand the PET design space tradeoffs, Figure \ref{fig:flex_comp}.B compares the PET flexural modulus of various member aspect ratios to a square cross-sectional beam of equal area. At low aspect ratios (shorter/thicker members), the mass of the PET remained close to the centroid, offering no significant moment of inertia benefit while simultaneously having sparse connectivity. As a result, the solid beam outperformed the PET. As PET member aspect ratios increased, the material was distributed farther from the centroid, causing the effective bending moment of inertia to increase. When the minimal aspect ratio of the PET surpassed 9.28, we saw improved flexural modulus results compared to those of the solid beam. As the PET member aspect ratio continued to increase, local bending of the slender beams became the dominant deformation mode, and the PET flexural modulus asymptotically approached 71\% improvement over the solid beam. 

The PET's aspect ratio directly correlates to the extension ratio (ER) and bending stiffness. By mass, hierarchical deployable structures with PETs as subcomponents only become structurally beneficial when the PET supports higher extension ratios. Many applications for deployable structures are volume rather than mass-constrained, making packing density an important consideration along with relative flexural modulus. The bespoke design enables the members to attain a stowage density of $50\%$ greater by reducing the height in the direction orthogonal to expansion, as opposed to a scissor mechanism with the same extension ratio and mass. This stowing benefit does not directly boost the ER of the PET, but within HERDS, the increased stowed density aligns with the extension axis.

\subsection{Design Tradeoffs of {Non-Planar Hierarchical Deployable}  Mechanisms}
{In this section, we revisit the volume-constrained design problem introduced in Section \ref{sec:herds:introduction}, focusing on the creation of kilometer-scale deployable structures from a single launch, Figure \ref{fig:enter-label}.A. We conduct a global design space sweep comparing the performance of the proposed non-planar hierarchical mechanism (HERDS) with its constituent substructures: the PET and Kresling (KRES) mechanisms. To systematically evaluate these structures, we generated over 2,300 designsâ€”approximately 500 HERDS, 1,000 PETs, and 800 KRESâ€”by sweeping key geometric parameters including member thickness and deployment angle, Figure \ref{fig:enter-label}.B. These parameters were selected for their direct impact on stowed and deployed height, allowing us to sample designs across a wide range of extension ratios (5xâ€“200x).}

{All designs were simulated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in ANSYS\textregistered APDL\cite{ansys_inc_ansys_nodate}, accessed through its Python API~\cite{alexander_kaszynski_2020_4009467}. The structures were modeled using BEAM188 elements with fixed joints (excluding joint mass) and subjected to bending, tension, compression, and torsional loading. For bending, compression, and tension simulations, we applied a displacement equal to $1\%$ of the final structure length, while torsional analysis used a fixed angular displacement of 3.6Â°. A full description of model assumptions, material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings is included in SM Section 5.3, 5.4, 6, SM Figure 8-9, and SM Table 2-3.}

{To contextualize performance across varying sizes and topologies, all results were normalized using the average performance of the HERDS designs. This allows for a clear comparison of stiffness trends across different structures and extension ratios. Only designs with extension ratios greater than or equal to 77x meet the kilometer-scale deployment target, however, we report results across the entire sampled range (5xâ€“200x) to identify the threshold at which HERDS surpasses its substructures. Data corresponding to extension ratios below 77x is shaded in grey in Figures \ref{fig:enter-label}.Câ€“F.}

{The results of this study reveal that hierarchical structures (HERDS) consistently outperform PET and KRES mechanisms in all loading conditionsâ€”bending, compression, tension, and torsionâ€”once the extension ratio exceeds approximately 25x. Figure \ref{fig:enter-label}.Câ€“F plots normalized stiffness as a function of extension ratio for each loading mode. As expected, stiffness generally decreases with increasing extension ratio across all structures. However, the rate of decline varies significantly.}

{KRES designs exhibit relatively high stiffness in bending, compression, and tension at low extension ratios but degrade sharply beyond 25x, often failing to converge due to local buckling instabilities. Furthermore, KRES designs perform the worst under torsional loading across all extension ratios, likely due to their unidirectional rotational compliance.}

{PET designs, on the other hand, demonstrate excellent deployment stability up to a 200x extension ratio without local buckling, particularly excelling in torsional stiffness. However, PETs show weaker bending, compression, and tension stiffness at low-to-moderate extension ratios when compared to KRES. This performance gap is likely due to the underutilization of available fairing volume, as PETs only occupy a small portion of the 5-meter diameter constraint.}

{HERDS structures strike a compelling balance between deployability and structural integrity. Beyond 25x extension, they consistently outperform both PET and KRES structures in all loading conditions. Importantly, these trends persist even after normalizing by mass, as shown in Figure SM 9 in the supplementary materials. However, we note that hierarchy is not always beneficial: below 25x extension, simpler substructures may offer better performance. Still, across the full design sweep, hierarchical composition reduces stiffness degradation at high extension ratios, validating the mechanical advantages of the HERDS approach.}

{To further explore these findings, we fabricated and tested a physical HERDS prototype, as described in the following section, to assess practical implementation and deployment reliability.}

\subsection{Fabrication and Testing of Prototype}
We constructed a practical scaled demonstration of the HERDS that integrates PETs and Kresling {deployable} mechanisms. The prototype was fabricated from over 1500 3D printed components and acrylic plates, combined to make 2 hierarchical Kresling cells, each with outer sub-members made of PETs. The structure smoothly transitioned from a height of 2.5 inches (0.05m) to approximately 8 feet (2.54m), using gravity as the deployment force (Video 1). Figure \ref{fig:large-HERDS}.A demonstrates the structure deployment, starting with the flat-packed configuration and extending to the full-length truss. Individual PET beams extended and popped into triangular trusses, with flexible TPU joints connecting individual scissor mechanisms. This physical model demonstrated cohesive reorientation of the many-component hierarchical structure without issues of jamming or mechanical frustration. The components included revolute joints with preloaded flexible tabs that automatically latched once each joint reached the fully deployed state, fixing its final position (details in SM. Figure 6).

Figure \ref{fig:large-HERDS}.B shows structure deformation given global compressive loading. Despite being constructed from hand-assembled PLA plastic with suboptimal joint design and fabrication inconsistencies, this model could support a compressive load of 15 pounds and a bending load of 12 pounds without global failure. Based on the initial and final loaded structure beam angles, while this model shows some flexing in individual beams, most of the structure's deformation occurs at the Kresling joints that combine each PET beam. These stress concentrations qualitatively match simulation results. These observations indicate that future work should further optimize the latching joints to withstand greater loads with less strain.  Enhanced joint tolerances, locking techniques, and material choices can further advance this design. Future work will seek to match the simulated results to the real data shown, with improvements towards modeling the joints, locking, and interfaces in the FEA simulation. Additional information about prototype fabrication and testing is added in SM Section 7 and SM Table 4.

It details three stages: from a completely flat-packed PET, indicative of its compact state, to the intermediate and fully extended forms, with the latter highlighting the extension capability, reaching a height of 244 cm from an initial compact height of just 6.3 cm. \textbf{B) Compressive Testing:} Presents a view of the HERDS under a compression test, leading to its faiure point, along with the corresponding stress-strain curve from the physical model testing. The curve displays the mechanical behavior of the HERDS, ending with a sharp increase in strain, which likely corresponds to the structural failure observed in the prototype.}\label{fig:large-HERDS}

\subsubsection{Locking Considerations}
{The effectiveness of locking elements plays a critical role in determining the stiffness and structural integrity of a deployed mechanism. For a deployable system to function as a load-bearing structure, it must transition smoothly into its deployed configuration and maintain rigidity under load. While locking strategies are highly application-dependent and a full global locking architecture is beyond the scope of this paper, we conducted a preliminary investigation into this area as a proof of concept.}

{We designed and tested several 3D-printed locking mechanisms for a triangular scissor structure, including: pin and corner lock, pin lock, ramp and corner lock, ramp lock, no lock, glued pin, and fully rigid. Using three-point bend tests on beams with rigid and deployable configurations, we derived an effective stiffness for each substructure. As shown in Supplementary Figure 6, the top-performing locking designs achieved approximately 80\% of the stiffness of a fully rigid connection. Notably, Figure \ref{fig:flex_comp}.B shows that the PET structure itself achieved a 71\% improvement in bending stiffness over a standard solid beam, demonstrating the structural benefit of the substructure despite some compliance introduced by the locking elements. Although optimizing locking mechanisms was not a central focus of this work, these findings highlight their importance and inform future directions. Since many of our prototypes were fabricated from 3D-printed PLA, we also tested reinforcement strategies such as tensioned cables (Figure SM 5) to enhance structural performance. Locking and reinforcement strategies will be critical for maturing deployable mechanisms into reliable, load-bearing structures.}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec12}
{
This work introduced Hierarchical Extending and Reorienting Deployable Structures (HERDS), a novel non-planar deployable mechanism composed of reorienting substructures. Through an extensive finite element design sweep, we demonstrated that HERDS outperforms its subcomponent mechanismsâ€”the Kresling and PET structuresâ€”in flexural, torsional, compressive, and tensile stiffness at high extension ratios (above 25x). These improvements stem from HERDSâ€™ ability to tightly pack in the stowed state while increasing bending resistance upon deployment, a benefit derived from the reorientation and composition of its substructures.}

{
Among the key findings, the Pop-Up Extending Truss (PET) plays a critical role by improving packing density when integrated with Kresling superstructures and contributing to a 71\% improvement in flexural modulus over a solid beam of equal mass. Compared to standard scissor mechanisms, PETs achieved over 100\% improvement in flexural modulus-to-mass ratio. However, at lower extension ratios (below 25x), traditional Kresling and PET mechanisms outperform HERDS due to the lower effective moment of inertia of reorienting small members.}

{We validated these trends with a 3D-printed HERDS prototype demonstrating smooth deployment at 50x expansion. Observations confirmed built-in redundancy: several members failed during repeated deployments without compromising overall function, suggesting inherent fault tolerance. However, critical challenges remain: the junctions between substructures are prone to stress concentration and require improved locking strategies to achieve load-bearing rigidity. Although preliminary locking mechanism tests yielded up to 80\% stiffness compared to rigid connections, robust, reusable, and scalable locking remains an open area of development.}

{Fabrication and joint design present key limitations that need to be further explored, due to the complex boundary conditions, especially for flight-rated materials and environments. Current prototypes used PLA and simple mechanical joints; transitioning to high-performance composites and precision-engineered joints and locking will be necessary for aerospace deployment. This investigated the performance within volume-constrained packaging scenarios, such as rocket fairings, and validated the performance against the system's substructures. Future studies will benchmark HERDS directly against the large corpus of aerospace deployables, including rollable booms, coilable masts, and stacers.}

{This work investigates a new class of non-planar hierarchical deployable structures with scalable applications. These mechanisms hold promise for space-based infrastructure, such as kilometer-scale artificial gravity habitats or large antennas, and for terrestrial needs, such as lightweight, stowable towers for disaster response or remote communications. Future work will explore joint design, locking strategies, fundamental frequency analysis, and robustness compared to existing solutions to ensure that the new designs proposed meet the demands of real-world deployment and enable richer capabilities for Earth and beyond.
