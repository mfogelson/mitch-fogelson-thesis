    abstract="Nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) represent a challenging class of optimization problems that often arise in engineering and scientific applications. Because of nonconvexities, these programs are typically solved with global optimization algorithms, which have limited scalability. However, nonlinear branch-and-bound has recently been shown to be an effective heuristic for quickly finding high-quality solutions to large-scale nonconvex MINLPs, such as those arising in infrastructure network optimization. This work proposes Juniper, a Julia-based open-source solver for nonlinear branch-and-bound. Leveraging the high-level Julia programming language makes it easy to modify Juniper's algorithm and explore extensions, such as branching heuristics, feasibility pumps, and parallelization. Detailed numerical experiments demonstrate that the initial release of Juniper is comparable with other nonlinear branch-and-bound solvers, such as Bonmin, Minotaur, and Knitro, illustrating that Juniper provides a strong foundation for further exploration in utilizing nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithms as heuristics for nonconvex MINLPs.",

The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.}",

   abstract = {A completely controllable linear dynamical system can be steered from any given initial state to any specified final state with an application of input control energy. The input control energy is provided through a combination of actuators. It is desirable to have a limited number of actuators, which also presents the possibility of multiple actuator combinations that render the system completely controllable. Hence, the optimal actuator placement problem very important in system design. Previous studies have been mainly focused on solving the optimal actuator placement problem using greedy heuristic methods which can provide a sub-optimal solution. In this work, the optimal actuator placement problem is presented as a 0/1-mixed integer semidefinite programming problem, and is solved using the branch-and-bound procedure. The problem formulation can be applied to both stable and unstable systems, and the solution procedure does not require an initial controllable actuator combination (starting point). Although no theoretical guarantees regarding optimality of the computed solution is provided in this work, numerical simulations performed on two examples yield the global optimal solution for the optimal actuator placement problem.},

   abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This paper describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulation method based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier methods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameter-izing a system's degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the system's dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the con-straints' topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate approaches , nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). This makes it practical to simulate complicated, closed-loop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is provided in pseudocode.},

Abstract: We present Dojo, a differentiable physics engine for robotics that prioritizes stable simulation, accurate contact physics, and differentiability with respect to states, actions, and system parameters. Dojo achieves stable simulation at low sample rates and conserves energy and momentum by employing a varia-tional integrator. A nonlinear complementarity problem, with second-order cones for friction, models hard contact and is reliably solved using a custom primal-dual interior-point method. Special properties of the interior-point method are exploited using the implicit-function theorem to efficiently compute smooth gradients that provide useful information through contact events. We demonstrate Dojo's unique ability to simulate hard contact while providing smooth, analytic gradients with a number of examples, including trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning, and system identification.},

   abstract = {While multi-joint continuum robots are highly dexterous and flexible, designing an optimal robot can be challenging due to its kinematics involving curvatures. Hence, the current work presents a computational method developed to find optimal designs of continuum robots, given reachability constraints. First, we leverage both forward and inverse kinematic computations to perform reachability analysis in an efficient yet accurate manner. While implementing inverse kinematics, we also integrate torque minimization at joints such that robot configurations with the minimum actuator torque required to reach a given workspace could be found. Lastly, we apply an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find optimal robot dimensions while considering reachability, where the objective function could be the total length of the robot or the actuator torque required to operate the robot. Through three application problems, we show that the EDA is superior to a genetic algorithm (GA) in finding better solutions within a given number of iterations, as the objective values of the best solutions found by the EDA are 4-15 lower than those found by the GA.},

   abstract = {An underactuated multibody system has less control inputs than degrees of freedom. For trajectory tracking, often a feedforward control is necessary. Two different approaches for feedforward control design are presented. The first approach is based on a coordinate transformation into the nonlinear input-output normal-form. The second approach uses servo-constraints and results in a set of differential algebraic equations. A comparison shows that both feedforward control designs have a similar structure. The analysis of the mechanical design of underactuated multibody systems might show that they are nonminimum phase, i.e., they have unstable internal dynamics. Then the feedforward control cannot be computed by time integration and output trajectory tracking becomes a very challenging task. Therefore, based on the two presented feedforward control design approaches, it is shown that through the use of an optimization procedure underactuated multibody systems can be designed in such a way that they are minimum phase. Thus, feedforward control design using the two approaches is significantly simplified. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

Here, a multimodal soft robot locomotion using highly compact and dynamic bistable soft actuators is achieved. These actuators are composed of a prestretched membrane sandwiched between two 3D printed frames with embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) coils. The actuator can swiftly transform between two oppositely curved states and generate a force of 0.3 N through a snap-through instability that is triggered after 0.2 s of electrical activation with an input power of 21.1 ± 0.32 W (i.e., electrical energy input of 4.22 ± 0.06 J. The consistency and robustness of the snap-through actuator response is experimentally validated through cyclical testing (580 cycles). The compact and fast-responding properties of the soft bistable actuator allow it to be used as an artificial muscle for shape-reconfigurable soft robots capable of multiple modes of SMA-powered locomotion. This is demonstrated by creating three soft robots, including a reconfigurable amphibious robot that can walk on land and swim in water, a jumping robot (multimodal crawler) that can crawl and jump, and a caterpillar-inspired rolling robot that can crawl and roll.},

  abstract = 	 {Aquatic locomotion is a classic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem of interest to biologists and engineers. Solving the fully coupled FSI equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes and finite elasticity is computationally expensive. Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally involves cumbersome, gradient-free procedures on top of the already costly simulation. To address this challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable hybrid approach to FSI that combines a 2D direct numerical simulation for the deformable solid structure of the swimmer and a physics-constrained neural network surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects of the fluid. For the deformable solid simulation of the swimmer’s body, we use state-of-the-art techniques from the field of computer graphics to speed up the finite-element method (FEM). For the fluid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture trained with a physics-based loss function to predict the flow field at each time step. The pressure and velocity field outputs from the neural network are sampled around the boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute its swimming motion accurately and efficiently. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D carangiform swimmer. Due to differentiability, the simulator can be used for computational design of controls for soft bodies immersed in fluids via direct gradient-based optimization.}

The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n).

Two optimization approaches are developed for both constrained and unconstrained gyroelastic bodies. The first is based on the controllability and observability matrices of the system.

	abstract = {Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgical systems enable procedures with reduced pain, recovery time, and scarring compared to traditional surgery. While these improvements benefit a large number of patients, safe access to diseased sites is not always possible for specialized patient groups, including pediatric patients, due to their anatomical differences. We propose a patient-specific design paradigm that leverages the surgeon’s expertise to design and fabricate robots based on preoperative medical images. The components of the patient-specific robot design process are a virtual reality design interface enabling the surgeon to design patient-specific tools, 3-D printing of these tools with a biodegradable polyester, and an actuation and control system for deployment. The designed robot is a concentric tube robot, a type of continuum robot constructed from precurved, elastic, nesting tubes. We demonstrate the overall patient-specific design workflow, from preoperative images to physical implementation, for an example clinical scenario: nonlinear renal access to a pediatric kidney. We also measure the system’s behavior as it is deployed through real and artificial tissue. System integration and successful benchtop experiments in ex vivo liver and in a phantom patient model demonstrate the feasibility of using a patient-specific design workflow to plan, fabricate, and deploy personalized, flexible continuum robots.},
