	abstract = {This paper deals with the kinematics of pantograph masts. Pantograph masts have widespread use in space application as deployable structures. They are over constrained mechanisms with degree-of-freedom, evaluated by the Grübler–Kutzback formula, as less than one. In this paper, a numerical algorithm is used to evaluate the degree-of-freedom of pantograph masts by obtaining the null space of a constraint Jacobian matrix. In the process redundant joints in the masts are obtained. A method based on symbolic computation, to obtain the closed-form kinematics equations of triangular and box shaped pantograph masts, is presented. In the process, the various configurations such masts can attain during deployment, are obtained. The closed-form solution also helps in identifying the redundant joints in the masts. The symbolic computations involving the Jacobian matrix also leads to a method to evaluate the global degree-of-freedom for these masts.},

	abstract = {Deployable structures have received much attention in the building of large structural systems in space due to the limitations in the packaging capabilities of satellites and launch vehicles. Among various categories of deployable structures, deployable truss structures are most commonly used because of their high stiffness and strength. However, deployable truss structures typically have low packaging efficiency. To improve the packaging efficiency of deployable truss structures, this paper proposes a deployable truss structure that can be stored in a flat form. The proposed structure has a high packaging efficiency while preserving the major advantage of conventional deployable truss structures. The deployment motion is analyzed through a kinematic model, and the packaging efficiency is calculated and compared to a conventional deployable truss structure. The dynamic model of the proposed structure is derived and the deployment characteristics are investigated considering the driving force for deployment and gravity. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed structure is demonstrated with a deployment test of the prototype.},

To further predict accurately the dynamic behaviors of solar-sail masts, nonlinear dynamic equation considering nonlinear geometric parameters and nonlinear strain of the mast is acquired by absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) is improved by introducing the Chebyshev polynomial approximation theory to raise the computational efficiency of the computation process on the mass matrix, stiffness matrix, and external force matrix of the nonlinear dynamic equation. Finally, the dynamic behaviors of the uniform mast, parabolic mast, and cylindrical mast under solar load are analyzed. The results show that the influence of the nonlinear parameters cannot be ignored, and the parabolic mast is more convenient in engineering than the cylindrical mast and uniform mast. In addition, the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method are better than those of the traditional computational method according to the analyses results. Thus, there are theoretical value and practical significance for the compositive technical performance of solar-sail mast.},

Before considering to develop larger launchers or to implement formation flying missions or in orbit assembly, the possibility of deploying structures once in orbit is an appealing solution. This paper describes the different technologies currently available to develop deployable structures, with an emphasis on those that can allow achieving long focal lengths. The review of these technologies is followed by a comparison of their performance and a list of trade-off parameters to be considered before selecting the most appropriate solution for a given application. Additionally, a preliminary structural analysis was performed on a typical deployable structure, applied to the case of a mission requiring a 20m focal length extension. The results show that by using several deployable masts, it is possible to build stiff deployed structures with eigen frequencies over 1Hz. Finally, a discussion on metrology concepts is provided, as knowledge of the relative position between the telescope and the deployed focal plane instruments is critical.},

Nevertheless, the deployable structures studied to date have the drawback of being too deformable, so that larger and therefore heavier sections had to be used. This paper proposes a new type of deployable structure that uses reciprocal linkages which give rise to greater strength and rigidity. The geometrical and mechanical conditions of the linkages are analysed, as several different types which perform better can be designed, and a calculation method is developed to analyse structures of this type. The features and behaviour of a flat mesh with articulated reciprocal linkages are also compared analytically and experimentally. The theoretical calculations and experimental tests make it possible to prove the viability and efficacy of this new structural type.},

Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite variants of these deployable booms have advantages over the metallic versions in the form of higher specific stiffness and greater design flexibility. A deployment failure mode called ‘blossoming’, in which the boom unwinds and extends within the deployment mechanism, can occur if an excessive load is applied to the boom tip. Blossoming can be mitigated by using compression rollers which radially constrain the coiled boom. An energy method is used to model the composite boom during deployment, and to predict the tip force a boom can withstand before blossoming occurs. The analytical results are compared with experimental results. The effects of the boom material properties and geometric parameters are investigated to provide more guidance in the design of deployable coilable boom systems.},

In the present work, a new four-cell lenticular honeycomb deployable (FLHD) boom is proposed, and the relevant parameters are optimized. Coiling dynamics analysis of the FLHD boom under a pure bending load is performed using nonlinear explicit dynamics analysis, and the coiling simulation is divided into three consecutive steps, namely, the flattening step, the holding step, and the hub coiling step. An optimal design method for the coiling of the FLHD boom is developed based on a back propagation neural network (BPNN). A full factorial design of the experimental method is applied to create 36 sample points, and surrogate models of the coiling peak moment (Mpeak) and maximum principal stress (Smax) are established using the BPNN. Fatigue cracks caused by stress concentration are avoided by setting Smax to a specific constraint and the wrapping Mpeak and mass of the FLHD boom as objectives. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used for optimization via ISIGHT software.},

To satisfy the requirements of specific specifications, such as having a small stowed volume, being light weight, having a large magnification ratio and an unrumpled retraction/deployment, an optimal design of the deployable boom is developed based on a review of its mechanical analysis. Therefore, the parameters of the boom's cross-section and the diameter of the storage reel are optimised using definite geometrical and physical constrains. Furthermore, by considering the geometrical dimensions and the energy equilibrium relationship constrains, key parameters of the retractable/deployable mechanism are deduced. Additionally, it is valuable to mention that the sequential quadratic programming method is adopted to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, the results of a finite element method are in good agreement with the aforementioned theoretical prediction, which validates the efficiency of the optimal design for the deployable boom.},

	abstract = {State of the art deployable structures are mainly being designed for medium to large size satellites. The lack of reliable deployable structural systems for low cost, small volume, rideshare-class spacecraft severely constrains the potential for using small satellite platforms for affordable deep space science and exploration precursor missions that could be realized with solar sails. There is thus a need for reliable, lightweight, high packaging efficiency deployable booms that can serve as the supporting structure for a wide range of small satellite systems including solar sails for propulsion. The National Air and Space Administration (NASA) is currently investing in the development of a new class of advanced deployable shell-based composite booms to support future deep space small satellite missions using solar sails. The concepts are being designed to: meet the unique requirements of small satellites, maximize ground testability, permit the use of low-cost manufacturing processes that will benefit scalability, be scalable for use as elements of hierarchical structures (e.g. trusses), allow long duration storage, have high deployment reliability, and have controlled deployment behavior and predictable deployed dynamics. This paper will present the various rollable boom concepts that are being developed for 5-20 m class size deployable structures that include solar sails with the so-called High Strain Composites (HSC) materials. The deployable composite booms to be presented are being developed to expand the portfolio of available rollable booms for small satellites and maximize their length for a given packaged volume. Given that solar sails are a great example of volume and mass optimization, the booms were designed to comply with nominal solar sail system requirements for 6U CubeSats, which are a good compromise between those of smaller form factors (1U, 2U and 3U CubeSats) and larger ones (12 U and 27 U future CubeSats, and ESPA-class microsatellites). Solar sail missions for such composite boom systems are already under consideration and development at NASA, as well as mission studies that will benefit from planned scaled-up versions of the composite boom technologies to be introduced. The paper presents ongoing research and development of thin-shell rollable composite booms designed under the particular stringent and challenging system requirements of relatively large solar sails housed on small satellites. These requirements will be derived and listed. Several new boom concepts are proposed and other existing ones are improved upon using thin-ply composite materials to yield unprecedented compact deployable structures. Some of these booms are shown in Fig. 1. For every boom to be introduced the scalable fabrication process developed to keep the overall boom system cost down will be shown. Finally, the initial results of purposely designed boom structural characterization test methods with gravity off-loading will be presented to compare their structural performance under expected and general load cases.},

          , 
            A foldable arm is one of the practical applications of folding. It can help mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) overcome access issues by allowing them to reach into confined spaces. The origami-inspired design enables a foldable structure to be lightweight, compact, and scalable while maintaining its kinematic behavior. However, the lack of structural stiffness has been a major limitation in the practical use of origami-inspired designs. Resolving this obstacle without losing the inherent advantages of origami is a challenge. We propose a solution by implementing a simple stiffening mechanism that uses an origami principle of perpendicular folding. The simplicity of the stiffening mechanism enables an actuation system to drive shape and stiffness changes with only a single electric motor. Our results show that this design was effective for a foldable arm and allowed a UAV to perform a variety of tasks in a confined space.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical lattices are made of finer lattices in successive smaller scales. This paper analytically studies the effect of hierarchy on the stiffness and strength of self-similar and hybrid type lattices, made by combining two distinct variants of topologies, governed by the bending and stretching dominated architectures. Scaling argument and physical reasoning are used to explain the behaviour of these lattices. The results show that the in-plane stiffness and the elastic buckling strength of the bending–bending lattices progressively improve with hierarchy; in contrast, only the buckling strength improves substantially for the stretching–stretching lattices, while the stiffness decreases. Low density bending–stretching lattices are unique with a significant improvement in stiffness, buckling, plastic collapse or crushing strength with hierarchy, whereas the stretching–bending lattices exhibit flexibility with lower strength. Despite no gain in stiffness, substantial gain in out-of-plane compressive strength is obtained with hierarchy because of the enhanced elastic and plastic buckling strength. Thus the advantage of combining lattices at multiple length scales provides a wide spectrum of choices for tailoring the properties for target applications including high performance core material, energy absorption or packaging.},

The analytical results show that (1) the buckling mode of a FASTMast deployable structure is similar to the elbow joint movement failure when the stiffness of the flex batten is below a critical stiffness value. Once this critical stiffness is reached, the buckling mode takes on the form of Euler buckling. (2) The stiffness of the flex batten is proportional to its cross-sectional second moment of area. Furthermore, an experimental study was carried out to validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. The results from experimental work agree fairly well with those from theoretical analysis.

By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.},

	abstract = {Origami crease patterns have inspired the design of reconfigurable materials that can transform their shape and properties through folding. Unfortunately, most designs cannot provide load-bearing capacity, and those that can, do so in certain directions but collapse along the direction of deployment, limiting their use as structural materials. Here, we merge notions of kirigami and origami to introduce a rigidly foldable class of cellular metamaterials that can flat-fold and lock into several states that are stiff across multiple directions, including the deployment direction. Our metamaterials rigidly fold with one degree of freedom and can reconfigure into several flat-foldable and spatially-lockable folding paths due to face contact. Locking under compression yields topology and symmetry changes that impart multidirectional stiffness. Additionally, folding paths and mixed-mode configurations can be activated in situ to modulate their properties. Their load-bearing capacity, flat-foldability, and reprogrammability can be harnessed for deployable structures, reconfigurable robots, and low-volume packaging.},

	abstract = {Flight is not the exclusive domain of birds; mammals (bats), insects, and some fish have independently developed this ability by the process of convergent evolution. Birds, however, greatly outperform other flying animals in efficiency and duration; for example the common swift (Apus apus) has recently been reported to regularly fly for periods of 10 months during migration. Birds owe this extraordinary capability to feathers and bones, which are extreme lightweight biological materials. They achieve this crucial function through their efficient design spanning multiple length scales. Both feathers and bones have unusual combinations of structural features organized hierarchically from nano- to macroscale and enable a balance between lightweight and bending/torsional stiffness and strength. The complementary features between the avian bone and feather are reviewed here, for the first time, and provide insights into nature's approach at creating structures optimized for flight. We reveal a novel aspect of the feather vane, showing that its barbule spacing is consistently within the range 8–16μm for birds of hugely different masses such as Anna's Hummingbird (Calypte anna) (4g) and the Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) (11,000g). Features of the feather and bone are examined using the structure-property relationships that define Materials Science. We elucidate the role of aerodynamic loading on observed reinforced macrostructural features and efficiently tailored shapes adapted for specialized applications, as well as composite material utilization. These unique features will inspire synthetic structures with maximized performance/weight for potential use in future transportation systems.},

	abstract = {Advances in manufacturing techniques may now realize virtually any imaginable microstructures, paving the way for architected materials with properties beyond those found in nature. This has lead to a quest for closing gaps in property-space by carefully designed metamaterials. Development of mechanical metamaterials has gone from open truss lattice structures to closed plate lattice structures with stiffness close to theoretical bounds. However, the quest for optimally stiff and strong materials is complex. Plate lattice structures have higher stiffness and (yield) strength but are prone to buckling at low volume fractions. Hence here, truss lattice structures may still be optimal. To make things more complicated, hollow trusses or structural hierarchy bring closed-walled microstructures back in the competition. Based on analytical and numerical studies of common microstructures from the literature, we provide higher order interpolation schemes for their effective stiffness and (buckling) strength. Furthermore, we provide a case study based on multi-property Ashby charts for weight-optimal porous beams under bending, that demonstrates the intricate interplay between structure and microarchitecture that plays the key role in the design of ultimate load carrying structures. The provided interpolation schemes may also be used to account for microstructural yield and buckling in multiscale design optimization schemes.},

Over one hundred years later, the same principle is being used in the fabrication of nanolattice materials, namely lattice structures composed of nanoscale constituents. Taking advantage of the size-dependent properties typical of nanoparticles, nanowires, and thin films, nanolattices redefine the limits of the accessible material-property space throughout different disciplines. Herein, the exceptional mechanical performance of nanolattices, including their ultrahigh strength, damage tolerance, and stiffness, are reviewed, and their potential for multifunctional applications beyond mechanics is examined. The efficient integration of architecture and size-affected properties is key to further develop nanolattices. The introduction of a hierarchical architecture is an effective tool in enhancing mechanical properties, and the eventual goal of nanolattice design may be to replicate the intricate hierarchies and functionalities observed in biological materials. Additive manufacturing and self-assembly techniques enable lattice design at the nanoscale; the scaling-up of nanolattice fabrication is currently the major challenge to their widespread use in technological applications.},

In this paper, we present hierarchical bi-material lattices that are stiff and can be designed to attain a theoretically unbounded range of thermal expansion without (i) impact onto elastic moduli and (ii) severe penalty in specific stiffness. Through a combination of theory, numerical simulations and experiments, we demonstrate the thermomechanical performance of eight hierarchical lattices, including two fractal-like hierarchical lattices with self-repeating units that are built from dual-material diamond shapes with low and high coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). Results show that the achievable range of CTE can be enlarged by 66\% through the addition of one order of hierarchy only, and that for a given CTE range the specific stiffness can be at least 1.4 times larger than that of existing stretch-dominated concepts. The concepts here introduced can open up new avenues towards multifunctional devices and structurally efficient materials with simultaneously customized thermal expansion and mechanical properties.},

Emerging fabrication methods have enabled the creation of materials with controllable architectures down to the nanoscale. These micro- and nanoarchitected materials utilize both resilient architectures and size-affected constituent materials to achieve unprecedented mechanical properties such as ultrahigh strength at low density, recoverability after large applied strains in intrinsically brittle materials, and metamaterial properties such as chirality and negative static compressibility. In this article, we describe the governing principles behind these materials and outline recent progress in the field.

A new material technology called Elastic Memory Composite (EMC) materials, shows promise in meeting these needs. The EMC polymer matrix materials enable a fully cured composite structure or component to be deformed or folded for efficient packaging into a spacecraft or launch vehicle, then regain its original shape with no degradation or loss in mechanical or physical properties. A component using EMC materials is fabricated in its deployed, on orbit shape using conventional composite manufacturing processes. Then by heating the material and applying force this fully cued composite material can be folded or deformed for packaging. When cooled, it will retain the packaged shape indefinitely. When reheated the structure will regain its original shape with little or no external force. This packaging/deployment cycle is reversible. This paper reviews new developments in EMC materials technology including material properties, analytical and designs tools, testing and evaluation protocols, and new applications.},

This provides enhanced tunability without necessarily changing the geometry of the system, a phenomenon which is not typically observed in other non-hierarchical unimode auxetic systems.

Here, we propose a new class of hierarchical auxetics based on the rotating rigid units mechanism. These systems retain the enhanced properties from having a negative Poisson's ratio with the added benefits of being a hierarchical system. Using simulations on typical hierarchical multi-level rotating squares, we show that, through design, one can control the extent of auxeticity, degree of aperture and size of the different pores in the system. This makes the system more versatile than similar non-hierarchical ones, making them promising candidates for industrial and biomedical applications, such as stents and skin grafts.},

It has been hypothesized that their mechanical robustness and damage tolerance stem from sophisticated ordering within the constituents, but the specific role of hierarchy remains to be fully described and understood. We apply the principles of hierarchical design to create structural metamaterials from three material systems: (i) polymer, (ii) hollow ceramic, and (iii) ceramic–polymer composites that are patterned into self-similar unit cells in a fractal-like geometry. In situ nanomechanical experiments revealed (i) a nearly theoretical scaling of structural strength and stiffness with relative density, which outperforms existing nonhierarchical nanolattices; (ii) recoverability, with hollow alumina samples recovering up to 98\% of their original height after compression to ≥50\% strain; (iii) suppression of brittle failure and structural instabilities in hollow ceramic hierarchical nanolattices; and (iv) a range of deformation mechanisms that can be tuned by changing the slenderness ratios of the beams. Additional levels of hierarchy beyond a second order did not increase the strength or stiffness, which suggests the existence of an optimal degree of hierarchy to amplify resilience. We developed a computational model that captures local stress distributions within the nanolattices under compression and explains some of the underlying deformation mechanisms as well as validates the measured effective stiffness to be interpreted as a metamaterial property.},

	abstract = {Origami has been employed to build deployable mechanical metamaterials through folding and unfolding along the crease lines. Deployable metamaterials are usually flexible, particularly along their deploying and collapsing directions, which unfortunately in many cases leads to an unstable deployed state, i.e., small perturbations may collapse the structure along the same deployment path. Here we create an origami-inspired mechanical metamaterial with on-demand deployability and selective collapsibility through energy analysis. This metamaterial has autonomous deployability from the collapsed state and can be selectively collapsed along two different paths, embodying low stiffness for one path and substantially high stiffness for another path. The created mechanical metamaterial yields load-bearing capability in the deployed direction while possessing great deployability and collapsibility. The principle in this work can be utilized to design and create versatile origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials that can find many applications.},

abstract = {Space deployable structures are able to be deployed from a folded state to a predetermined or desired configuration. They are superior in terms of spatial packaging ratio, controllability, and structural complexity, in order to solve the space limitations for aerospace vehicles. Therefore, they have been applied in structural designs and concepts for various aerospace missions, including space support booms, space deployable antennas, solar panels, as well as flexible solar sails. Recent development of advanced manufacturing technologies and applications of novel smart materials and structures, brings new degree of design freedom to space deployable mechanics, inspiring novel space deployable mechanisms, especially for smart driving and control strategies. Here, we present a review on development of mechanics and smart driving of space deployable structures. Advantages and limitations for various deployable mechanisms are also presented to reveal further insights. The trends and future deployable mechanics are directed by further advancements in terms of modularisation, intelligences, and deployment precision. Multi-disciplinary cross-integrations are leading the way for future breakthroughs in novel deployable mechanics and intelligent driving control for space explorations.}

In this paper, the development and technologies for ISA are reviewed. ISA is classified from multiple angles, and the research status of ISA is shown clearly through the visual mapping knowledge domain. Then the development status of autonomous robot assembly in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and China is reviewed. Furthermore, the key technologies of ISA are analyzed from three aspects: assembly structure design, robot technologies and integrated management technologies. ISA technologies are still facing major challenges and need to be further explored to promote future development. Finally, future development trends and potential applications of ISA are given, which show that ISA will play a vital role in human space exploration in the future.},

These characteristics introduce benefits when considering issues such as ease of transportation, erection and the overall sustainability of the structure by means of high material efficiency, modularisation and maximum use of natural energy resources. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of existing attempts at classifying deployable structures identifying connections between different families through their mechanical and structural behaviours. The classifications selected consider theoretical and applied deployable structures, not focusing on a single application of deployable structures but including those ranging from spatial applications, to temporary and disaster relief structure, through to medical applications, providing coherence where terminology varies between applications. In order to gain a consistent understanding, tree diagrams were created for the review/classification to allow drawing commonalities and establishing differences between authors. A chronological approach was adopted, using key review work as focal points for the timeline, complemented by smaller more specific pieces of work. This enabled the identification of common features and divergences between the different authors, bringing to the conclusion that a clear, comprehensive, consistent and unified classification of deployable structures is currently missing within the field. }

However, designing models to find molecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex and non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional network based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement learning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that incorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can achieve 61\% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art baselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184\% improvement on the constrained property optimization task.},

            Generative design problems often encompass complex action spaces that may be divergent over time, contain state-dependent constraints, or involve hybrid (discrete and continuous) domains. To address those challenges, this work introduces Design Strategy Network (DSN), a data-driven deep hierarchical framework that can learn strategies over these arbitrary complex action spaces. The hierarchical architecture decomposes every action decision into first predicting a preferred spatial region in the design space and then outputting a probability distribution over a set of possible actions from that region. This framework comprises a convolutional encoder to work with image-based design state representations, a multi-layer perceptron to predict a spatial region, and a weight-sharing network to generate a probability distribution over unordered set-based inputs of feasible actions. Applied to a truss design study, the framework learns to predict the actions of human designers in the study, capturing their truss generation strategies in the process. Results show that DSNs significantly outperform non-hierarchical methods of policy representation, demonstrating their superiority in complex action space problems.},

	abstract = {Invariant and equivariant networks have been successfully used for learning images, sets, point clouds, and graphs. A basic challenge in developing such networks is finding the maximal collection of invariant and equivariant linear layers. Although this question is answered for the first three examples (for popular transformations, at-least), a full characterization of invariant and equivariant linear layers for graphs is not known. In this paper we provide a characterization of all permutation invariant and equivariant linear layers for (hyper-)graph data, and show that their dimension, in case of edge-value graph data, is 2 and 15, respectively. More generally, for graph data defined on k-tuples of nodes, the dimension is the k-th and 2k-th Bell numbers. Orthogonal bases for the layers are computed, including generalization to multi-graph data. The constant number of basis elements and their characteristics allow successfully applying the networks to different size graphs. From the theoretical point of view, our results generalize and unify recent advancement in equivariant deep learning. In particular, we show that our model is capable of approximating any message passing neural network Applying these new linear layers in a simple deep neural network framework is shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art and to have better expressivity than previous invariant and equivariant bases.},

Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Engineering design problems often involve large state and action spaces along with highly sparse rewards. Since an exhaustive search of those spaces is not feasible, humans utilize relevant domain knowledge to condense the search space. Deep learning agents (DLAgents) were previously introduced to use visual imitation learning to model design domain knowledge. This note builds on DLAgents and integrates them with one-step lookahead search to develop goal-directed agents capable of enhancing learned strategies for sequentially generating designs. Goal-directed DLAgents can employ human strategies learned from data along with optimizing an objective function. The visual imitation network from DLAgents is composed of a convolutional encoder–decoder network, acting as a rough planning step that is agnostic to feedback. Meanwhile, the lookahead search identifies the fine-tuned design action guided by an objective. These design agents are trained on an unconstrained truss design problem modeled as a sequential, action-based configuration design problem. The agents are then evaluated on two versions of the problem: the original version used for training and an unseen constrained version with an obstructed construction space. The goal-directed agents outperform the human designers used to train the network as well as the previous feedback-agnostic versions of the agent in both scenarios. This illustrates a design agent framework that can efficiently use feedback to not only enhance learned design strategies but also adapt to unseen design problems.},

In this framework, we represent each robot design as a graph, and use a graph grammar to express possible arrangements of physical robot assemblies. Each robot design can then be expressed as a sequence of grammar rules. Using only a small set of rules our grammar can describe hundreds of thousands of possible robot designs. The construction of the grammar limits the design space to designs that can be fabricated. For a given input terrain, the design space is searched to find the top performing robots and their corresponding controllers. We introduce Graph Heuristic Search - a novel method for efficient search of combinatorial design spaces. In Graph Heuristic Search, we explore the design space while simultaneously learning a function that maps incomplete designs (e.g., nodes in the combinatorial search tree) to the best performance values that can be achieved by expanding these incomplete designs. Graph Heuristic Search prioritizes exploration of the most promising branches of the design space. To test our method we optimize robots for a number of challenging and varied terrains.

            Humans as designers have quite versatile problem-solving strategies. Computer agents on the other hand can access large-scale computational resources to solve certain design problems. Hence, if agents can learn from human behavior, a synergetic human-agent problem-solving team can be created. This paper presents an approach to extract human design strategies and implicit rules, purely from historical human data, and use that for design generation. A two-step framework that learns to imitate human design strategies from observation is proposed and implemented. This framework makes use of deep learning constructs to learn to generate designs without any explicit information about objective and performance metrics. The framework is designed to interact with the problem through a visual interface as humans did when solving the problem. It is trained to imitate a set of human designers by observing their design state sequences without inducing problem-specific modeling bias or extra information about the problem. Furthermore, an end-to-end agent is developed that uses this deep learning framework as its core in conjunction with image processing to map pixel-to-design moves as a mechanism to generate designs. Finally, the designs generated by a computational team of these agents are then compared with actual human data for teams solving a truss design problem. Results demonstrate that these agents are able to create feasible and efficient truss designs without guidance, showing that this methodology allows agents to learn effective design strategies.},

In this paper, we applied kinematic mapping theory to planar discrete motion synthesis of an arbitrary number of approximated poses as well as up to four exact poses. A simultaneous type and dimensional synthesis approach is presented, aiming at the problem of mixed exact and approximate motion realization with three types of planar dyad chains (RR, RP, and PR). A two-step unified strategy is established: first N given approximated poses are utilized to formulate a general quadratic surface fitting problem in hyperspace, then up to four exact poses could be imposed as pose-constraint equations to this surface fitting system such that they could be strictly satisfied. The former step, the surface fitting problem, is converted to a linear system with two quadratic constraint equations, which could be solved by a null-space analysis technique. On the other hand, the given exact poses in the latter step are formulated as linear pose-constraint equations and added back to the system, where both type and dimensions of the resulting optimal dyads could be determined by the solution. These optimal dyads could then be implemented as different types of four-bar linkages or parallel manipulators. The result is a novel algorithm that is simple and efficient, which allows for N-pose motion approximation of planar dyads containing both revolute and prismatic joints, as well as handling of up to four prescribed poses to be realized precisely.},

Given a working linkage as input, the user can make targeted edits to the shape or motion of selected parts while preserving other, e.g., functionally-important aspects. In order to make this process intuitive and efficient, we provide a number of editing tools at different levels of abstraction. For instance, the user can directly change the structure of a linkage by displacing joints, edit the motion of selected points on the linkage, or impose limits on the size of its enclosure. Our method safeguards against degenerate configurations during these edits, thus ensuring the correct functioning of the mechanism at all times. Linkage editing poses strict requirements on performance that standard approaches fail to provide. In order to enable interactive and robust editing, we build on a symbolic kinematics approach that uses closed-form expressions instead of numerical methods to compute the motion of a linkage and its derivatives. We demonstrate our system on a diverse set of examples, illustrating the potential to adapt and personalize the structure and motion of existing linkages. To validate the feasibility of our edited designs, we fabricated two physical prototypes.},

	abstract = {The leg mechanism of the novel jumping robot, Salto, is designed to achieve multiple functions during the sub-200 ms time span that the leg interacts with the ground, including minimizing impulse loading, balancing angular momentum, and manipulating power output of the robot's series-elastic actuator. This is all accomplished passively with a single degree-of-freedom linkage that has a coupled, unintuitive design which was synthesized using the technique described in this paper. Power delivered through the mechanism is increased beyond the motor's limit by using variable mechanical advantage to modulate energy storage and release in a series-elastic actuator. This power modulating behavior may enable high amplitude, high frequency jumps. We aim to achieve all required behaviors with a linkage composed only of revolute joints, simplifying the robot's hardware but necessitating a complex design procedure since there are no pre-existing solutions. The synthesis procedure has two phases: (1) design exploration to initially compile linkage candidates, and (2) kinematic tuning to incorporate power modulating characteristics and ensure an impulse-limited, rotation-free jump motion. The final design is an eight-bar linkage with a stroke greater than half the robot's total height that produces a simulated maximum jump power 3.6 times greater than its motor's limit. A 0.27 m tall prototype is shown to exhibit minimal pitch rotations during meter high test jumps.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a design methodology for Stephenson II six-bar function generators that coordinate 11 input and output angles. A complex number formulation of the loop equations yields 70 quadratic equations in 70 unknowns, which is reduced to a system of ten eighth degree polynomial equations of total degree 810=1.07×109. These equations have a monomial structure which yields a multihomogeneous degree of 264,241,152. A sequence of polynomial homotopies was used to solve these equations and obtain 1,521,037 nonsingular solutions. Contained in these solutions are linkage design candidates which are evaluated to identify cognates, and then analyzed to determine their input–output angles in each assembly. The result is a set of feasible linkage designs that reach the required accuracy points in a single assembly. As an example, three Stephenson II function generators are designed, which provide the input–output functions for the hip, knee, and ankle of a humanoid walking gait.},

@article{baraff_linear-time_1996,
	title = {Linear-{Time} {Dynamics} using {Lagrange} {Multipliers}},
	abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This paper describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulation method based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier methods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameter-izing a system's degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the system's dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the con-straints' topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate approaches , nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). This makes it practical to simulate complicated, closed-loop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is provided in pseudocode.},

    abstract="Nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) represent a challenging class of optimization problems that often arise in engineering and scientific applications. Because of nonconvexities, these programs are typically solved with global optimization algorithms, which have limited scalability. However, nonlinear branch-and-bound has recently been shown to be an effective heuristic for quickly finding high-quality solutions to large-scale nonconvex MINLPs, such as those arising in infrastructure network optimization. This work proposes Juniper, a Julia-based open-source solver for nonlinear branch-and-bound. Leveraging the high-level Julia programming language makes it easy to modify Juniper's algorithm and explore extensions, such as branching heuristics, feasibility pumps, and parallelization. Detailed numerical experiments demonstrate that the initial release of Juniper is comparable with other nonlinear branch-and-bound solvers, such as Bonmin, Minotaur, and Knitro, illustrating that Juniper provides a strong foundation for further exploration in utilizing nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithms as heuristics for nonconvex MINLPs.",

The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.}",

The input control energy is provided through a combination of actuators. It is desirable to have a limited number of actuators, which also presents the possibility of multiple actuator combinations that render the system completely controllable. Hence, the optimal actuator placement problem very important in system design. Previous studies have been mainly focused on solving the optimal actuator placement problem using greedy heuristic methods which can provide a sub-optimal solution. In this work, the optimal actuator placement problem is presented as a 0/1-mixed integer semidefinite programming problem, and is solved using the branch-and-bound procedure. The problem formulation can be applied to both stable and unstable systems, and the solution procedure does not require an initial controllable actuator combination (starting point). Although no theoretical guarantees regarding optimality of the computed solution is provided in this work, numerical simulations performed on two examples yield the global optimal solution for the optimal actuator placement problem.},

   abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This paper describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulation method based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier methods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameter-izing a system's degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the system's dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the con-straints' topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate approaches , nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). This makes it practical to simulate complicated, closed-loop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is provided in pseudocode.},

Abstract: We present Dojo, a differentiable physics engine for robotics that prioritizes stable simulation, accurate contact physics, and differentiability with respect to states, actions, and system parameters. Dojo achieves stable simulation at low sample rates and conserves energy and momentum by employing a varia-tional integrator. A nonlinear complementarity problem, with second-order cones for friction, models hard contact and is reliably solved using a custom primal-dual interior-point method. Special properties of the interior-point method are exploited using the implicit-function theorem to efficiently compute smooth gradients that provide useful information through contact events. We demonstrate Dojo's unique ability to simulate hard contact while providing smooth, analytic gradients with a number of examples, including trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning, and system identification.},

Hence, the current work presents a computational method developed to find optimal designs of continuum robots, given reachability constraints. First, we leverage both forward and inverse kinematic computations to perform reachability analysis in an efficient yet accurate manner. While implementing inverse kinematics, we also integrate torque minimization at joints such that robot configurations with the minimum actuator torque required to reach a given workspace could be found. Lastly, we apply an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find optimal robot dimensions while considering reachability, where the objective function could be the total length of the robot or the actuator torque required to operate the robot. Through three application problems, we show that the EDA is superior to a genetic algorithm (GA) in finding better solutions within a given number of iterations, as the objective values of the best solutions found by the EDA are 4-15 lower than those found by the GA.},

   abstract = {An underactuated multibody system has less control inputs than degrees of freedom. For trajectory tracking, often a feedforward control is necessary. Two different approaches for feedforward control design are presented. The first approach is based on a coordinate transformation into the nonlinear input-output normal-form. The second approach uses servo-constraints and results in a set of differential algebraic equations. A comparison shows that both feedforward control designs have a similar structure. The analysis of the mechanical design of underactuated multibody systems might show that they are nonminimum phase, i.e., they have unstable internal dynamics. Then the feedforward control cannot be computed by time integration and output trajectory tracking becomes a very challenging task. Therefore, based on the two presented feedforward control design approaches, it is shown that through the use of an optimization procedure underactuated multibody systems can be designed in such a way that they are minimum phase. Thus, feedforward control design using the two approaches is significantly simplified. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

abstract = {Abstract Matching the rich multimodality of natural organisms, i.e., the ability to transition between crawling and swimming, walking and jumping, etc., represents a grand challenge in the fields of soft and bio-inspired robotics. Here, a multimodal soft robot locomotion using highly compact and dynamic bistable soft actuators is achieved. These actuators are composed of a prestretched membrane sandwiched between two 3D printed frames with embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) coils. The actuator can swiftly transform between two oppositely curved states and generate a force of 0.3 N through a snap-through instability that is triggered after 0.2 s of electrical activation with an input power of 21.1 ± 0.32 W (i.e., electrical energy input of 4.22 ± 0.06 J. The consistency and robustness of the snap-through actuator response is experimentally validated through cyclical testing (580 cycles). The compact and fast-responding properties of the soft bistable actuator allow it to be used as an artificial muscle for shape-reconfigurable soft robots capable of multiple modes of SMA-powered locomotion. This is demonstrated by creating three soft robots, including a reconfigurable amphibious robot that can walk on land and swim in water, a jumping robot (multimodal crawler) that can crawl and jump, and a caterpillar-inspired rolling robot that can crawl and roll.},

Solving the fully coupled FSI equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes and finite elasticity is computationally expensive. Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally involves cumbersome, gradient-free procedures on top of the already costly simulation. To address this challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable hybrid approach to FSI that combines a 2D direct numerical simulation for the deformable solid structure of the swimmer and a physics-constrained neural network surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects of the fluid. For the deformable solid simulation of the swimmer’s body, we use state-of-the-art techniques from the field of computer graphics to speed up the finite-element method (FEM). For the fluid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture trained with a physics-based loss function to predict the flow field at each time step. The pressure and velocity field outputs from the neural network are sampled around the boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute its swimming motion accurately and efficiently. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D carangiform swimmer. Due to differentiability, the simulator can be used for computational design of controls for soft bodies immersed in fluids via direct gradient-based optimization.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a control design for flexible manipulators using piezoelectric actuators bonded on nonprismatic links. The dynamic model of the manipulator is obtained in a closed form through the Lagrange equations. Each link is discretized using finite element modal formulation based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The control uses the motor torques and piezoelectric actuators for controlling vibrations. An optimization problem with genetic algorithm (GA) is formulated for the location and size of the piezoelectric actuator and sensor on the links. The natural frequencies and mode shapes are computed by the finite element method, and the irregular beam geometry is approximated by piecewise prismatic elements. The State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) technique is used to derive a suboptimal controller for a robot control problem. A state-dependent equation is solved at each new point obtained for the variables from the problem, along the trajectory to obtain a nonlinear feedback controller. Numerical tests verify the efficiency of the proposed optimization and control design.},

	abstract = {Gyroelastic body refers to a flexible structure with a distribution of stored angular momentum provided by fly wheels or control moment gyroscopes. The angular momentum devices can exert active torques to the structure for vibration suppression or shape control. This article mainly focuses on the placement optimization issue of the actuators and sensors on the gyroelastic body. The control moment gyroscopes and angular rate sensors are adopted as actuators and sensors, respectively. The equations of motion of the gyroelastic body incorporating the detailed actuator dynamics are linearized to a loosely coupled state-space model. Two optimization approaches are developed for both constrained and unconstrained gyroelastic bodies. The first is based on the controllability and observability matrices of the system. It is only applicable to the collocated actuator and sensor pairs. The second criterion is formulated from the concept of controllable and observable subspaces. It is capable of handling the cases of both collocated and noncollocated actuator and sensor pairs. The illustrative examples of a cantilevered beam and an unconstrained plate demonstrate the clear physical meaning and rationality of the two proposed methods.},

We introduce a design optimization method to compute kinematic design parameters that enable a single robot to reach as many desirable goal regions as possible while avoiding obstacles in an environment. Our method appropriately integrates sampling-based motion planning in configuration space into stochastic optimization in design space so that, over time, our evaluation of a design’s ability to reach goals increases in accuracy and our selected designs approach global optimality. We prove the asymptotic optimality of our method and demonstrate performance in simulation for (1) a serial manipulator and (2) a concentric tube robot, a tentacle-like medical robot that can bend around anatomical obstacles to safely reach clinically-relevant goal regions.},

While these improvements benefit a large number of patients, safe access to diseased sites is not always possible for specialized patient groups, including pediatric patients, due to their anatomical differences. We propose a patient-specific design paradigm that leverages the surgeon’s expertise to design and fabricate robots based on preoperative medical images. The components of the patient-specific robot design process are a virtual reality design interface enabling the surgeon to design patient-specific tools, 3-D printing of these tools with a biodegradable polyester, and an actuation and control system for deployment. The designed robot is a concentric tube robot, a type of continuum robot constructed from precurved, elastic, nesting tubes. We demonstrate the overall patient-specific design workflow, from preoperative images to physical implementation, for an example clinical scenario: nonlinear renal access to a pediatric kidney. We also measure the system’s behavior as it is deployed through real and artificial tissue. System integration and successful benchtop experiments in ex vivo liver and in a phantom patient model demonstrate the feasibility of using a patient-specific design workflow to plan, fabricate, and deploy personalized, flexible continuum robots.},

An analogous problem of indeterminacy is also present in overactuated MBSs. This paper discusses the constraint-matrix-based method for the uniqueness analysis of the reactions and driving forces (torques) for MBSs with nonholonomic constraints. Four approaches are studied: The rank comparison, SVD, QR, and nullspace methods. The uniqueness criteria are written in a new way. The equivalence of the SVD, QR, and nullspace methods is shown. It is also presented how to check the uniqueness of the selected elements (reactions, driving forces, or more complex combinations) and their individual components. Subsequently, the impact of the driving constraints on the uniqueness of the joint reactions is discussed. Next, the uniqueness analysis using these three methods is extended to perform a newly proposed body-wise analysis instead of the usual constraint-wise analysis. Two examples of spatial systems (one with nonholonomic constraints) are considered to illustrate the approach. Moreover, the computational efficiency of selected methods is analyzed.},

In this paper it is shown that despite the fact that all of the constraint reactions cannot be uniquely determined, selected single constraint reactions or selected groups of reactions can be specified uniquely. Conditions, which must be fulfilled to obtain unique values of selected reaction forces in the presence of dependent constraints, are presented and proven.

This is the DOF of almost all mechanisms that can be built from a given set of kinematic pairs in a certain arrangement, but with arbitrary link geometry. The generic DOF is the most likely DOF in the presence of link imperfections. Furthermore, we are interested in the generic DOF of different types of mechanisms, i.e. when the link geometries are arbitrary, but in accordance with a certain type (e.g. planar, spherical, spatial). A widely used mobility criterion is the extended Chebychev–Kutzbach–Grübler (CKG) formula. It is proven in this paper that the generic DOF of a mechanism comprising loops of specific motion types, such as planar, spherical, and spacial, is indeed given by the extended CKG formula. In particular, mechanisms with arbitrary link geometry have generically a DOF δ=n-6γ, where γ is the number of fundamental loops, and n is the total number of joint freedoms. That is, almost all mechanisms are trivial (not overconstrained). Moreover, such mechanisms have generically no configuration space singularities. The mobility and the classification of mechanisms as overconstrained, underconstrained, or kinematotropic is considered in view of the configuration space. It is pointed out that the local DOF cannot always be inferred from the number of constraints (overconstrained mechanisms) nor can the differential DOF always be deduced from the local DOF (underconstrained mechanisms).},

The dynamic equations are established by combining the Newton–Euler equations with modified contact force model and improved Coulomb friction force model, and the Baumgarte stabilization approach is used to improve the numerical stability. According to numerical and experimental results, the method of continuous contact can be verified to be reasonable. Comparing dynamic the response between one clearance joint and two clearance joints in a crank-slider mechanism, it is easy to find a significant mutual coupling region due to the presence of two clearance joints by simply contact figures. The dynamic response in a mechanism with two clearance joints is not a simple superposition of that in mechanism with one clearance joint.

Such clearance is necessary for the component assemblage and to allow the relative motion between the connected bodies. This clearance is inevitable due to the manufacturing tolerances, material deformations, wear, and imperfections. The presence of such joint clearance degrades the performance of mechanical systems in virtue of the contact and impact forces that take place at the joint. Contact analysis is a computational bottleneck in mechanical design where the contact changes. Manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to error. To address these problems, a geometrical contact analysis method based on kinematic simulation, using CAD software is developed. An equivalent kinematic linkage mechanism is constructed according to contact position of pin and hole assembly. Results of kinematic and dynamic analysis of a four bar linkage with joint clearance shows that the contribution of joint forces at slower input speed also degrades the performance of mechanism.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms are prone to stuttering or even jamming due to the deformation of components, especially for overconstrained linkages for which geometric conditions must be strictly satisfied. In this paper, joint clearance is actively introduced to release the local constraint so that the linkages can still achieve general movement under the deformation of components. And a joint clearance model with a revolute joint (R-joint) is built. Based on the model, the minimum joint clearance introduced, which keeps mechanisms moving smoothly, is found when the components of the linkages have a certain deformation. The correctness of the proposed method is verified with a numerical case, and the optimal position for clearance introducing is analyzed. It opens up an important way to solve the phenomenon of stuttering or jamming in overconstrained linkages.},

	abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope is NASA’s flagship mission and successor to the highly successful Hubble Space Telescope. It is an infrared observatory featuring a cryogenic 6.6 m aperture, deployable optical telescope element with a payload of four science instruments assembled into an integrated science instrument module that provide imagery and spectroscopy in the near infrared band between 0.6 and 5 μm and in the mid-infrared band between 5 and 28 μm. JWST was successfully launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. All 50 major deployments were successfully completed by January 8, 2022. The observatory performed all mid-course correction maneuvers and achieved its operational mission orbit around the Sun-Earth second Lagrange Point. All commissioning and calibration activities have been completed and JWST has begun its science mission. Its present performance meets or out-performs all requirements. Launching over 20 years after its mission concept review, the JWST Observatory is a first and only of its kind of facility. This program faced many unique challenges that were not only technical in nature but also organizational and managerial. We describe the challenges faced by the JWST systems engineering team, the way the team addressed them, and make recommendations for focus areas of future flagship missions, which will likely face similar challenges. It will not explicitly address the cost challenges of the mission. We first describe the mission and its over-arching challenges. We then describe the tailoring of systems engineering processes and methods used to address these challenges and effectiveness. The events, tasks, issues, and their resolutions and the resulting specific lessons learned from the project are discussed with the over-arching recommendations for future flagship missions that derive from these lessons.},
